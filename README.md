This repository is a fruit of long hours of work, carrying out the building of an Artificial Intelligence algorithm, based on the DCGAN model, 
capable of creating countless and unique pieces of abstract art from absolute scratch as all human artists do. My work questions the obviousness, the primitiveness, and the callous nature of AI algorithms.

I'd love to emphasize how unique and yet human-like could be the way machines learn. They do it like kids, first by imitating what other people do and what they say, then by trying out how things work by themselves.
Just like that, my model first tries to find common patterns in the training data, then adds some colors to the image, and later on, would be able to draw some shapes and mix them with colors already drawn.

Due to the lack of background in arts, I would not dare to claim to be an artist myself, yet my algorithm certainly would. It can produce abstract paintings with a clean slate (starting with just nothing but noise), inspired by 8145 images from the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/greg115/abstract-art).
Here is the set of 128x128 pixels authentic and realistic abstract pieces of 
ART, created by ARTificial intelligence:
